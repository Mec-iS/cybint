A paper about how Machine Learning and philosophical research. 

## Abstract
Human activities are progressively defined by interactions with products that
embed increasingly higher levels of immaterial component (software, patents, design
principles and patterns). After presenting the continuity between seminal concepts
in Cybernetics, Information Theory, Network Analysis, AI practices on one side
and cognitive behaviour by leveraging a minimalist approach to cybernetic systems
based on the concept of capacity of network; the text tries to establish the concept
of interface to define logical rule-based automata that can be considered sharable
instances of a self-model approach to consciousness: in first instance, a rule-based
descriptive construct for an ’economy of information exchange’ between systems (or
an ’economy of time’), and in second instance a rule-based framework for approach-
ing the hard problem of consciousness. These are critical waypoints in navigating
fast-growing knowledge-intensive landscapes. This review into patterns of growing
complexity is concluded with an hypothesis that aims to extend Ashby’s definition
of machine to include interfaces to represent self-modeling.
